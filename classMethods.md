Class methods in Python are used for various purposes, including:
Factory methods: Class methods can be used as factory methods to create new instances of the class with specific properties or configurations. This is useful when you want to provide alternative constructors for your class

.
Utility methods: Class methods can be used to implement utility functions that are related to the class but do not depend on the state of an instance. These methods can be called on the class itself without creating an instance

.
Working with class-level attributes: Class methods can be used to modify or access class-level attributes, which are shared among all instances of the class. This is useful when you want to maintain a global state or configuration for all instances of the class

.
Inheritance and polymorphism: Class methods can be overridden in subclasses to provide different implementations for the same method. This allows for polymorphism, where a method can have different behaviors depending on the class it is called on
